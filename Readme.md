# Esp32 Beerbong project:
This is a private project what i did where i tried how much time it took to finish one Beerbong.

A Beerbong with time measurement. An ESP32 measures the conductivity between to stainless steel pipes. Is the conductivity high it means a liquid is flowing and the time measurement starts.
